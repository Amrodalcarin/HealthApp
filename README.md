# HealthApp - NutriCare

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/7f2d90ad-f530-45e4-930c-fef690c3eb7a/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/quirky-saha-363880/deploys)

This was the final proyect for the FrontEnd Programming Course of EOI.

For the proyect to run you will need the Food Database API and Recipe Search API from developer.edamam.com/ and also you will need the Firebase API from firebase.google.com/ for authentication.

You can find the API template files on this repo but, we highly recommend put the api files into the backend so you api keys don't get exposed.
